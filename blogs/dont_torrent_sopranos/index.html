	<h2><a style="color: #fe8019;">Do NOT torrent The Sopranos onto Western Digital Part#: WDBYVG0020BRD-WESN</a></h2>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		Nothing really new here. 
		The drive fixed itself, and I tried a third time just to confirm. 
		The Sopranos (.iso) is now 100% the reason.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		What I discovered, however, was that it doesn't matter where the torrent comes from. 
		If it's The Sopranos, it will break the drive. 
		I have torrented The Sopranos from three separate sources now, all in different qualities and file types, and without fail, it freezes the drive.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		Again, it's not like my drive is broken. 
		Because before I try to torrent The Sopranos, I make sure to torrent other files first and test them. 
		These other files always work, but when I try to torrent The Sopranos, it breaks.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		Anyway, that's the update. 
		Nothing new, just wanted to triple confirm that it's The Sopranos which is the issue. 
		So if you have a Western Digital Part#: WDBYVG0020BRD-WESN, don't download The Sopranos on it. 
		Or, if you do and it works, please tell me how.
