		Welcome to the fourth, and final, part of the faulty external HDD adventures. 
		Yesterday, I torrented The Sopranos directly onto my desktop. 
		This worked, and playback was seamless. 
		I then tried transferring the files to the external HDD, which at this point was plugged into my desktop. 
		All was going well until around 30%.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		Transfer speeds dropped to around 300KB/s, and File Explorer crashed. 
		For context, I had convinced myself Linux was the issue, so I resorted to fixing this issue in Windows. 
		In a panic, I attempted to eject the drive, to no success. 
		I then shut down my computer, only for it to freeze. 
		I waited 10 minutes and eventually decided to unplug the external HDD, and my computer immediately unfroze and shut down properly.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		After rebooting, I plugged the drive back in, then it started clicking. 
		It is now refusing to cooperate with any of my machines, whether it be Linux or Windows. 
		In Windows, when I do plug the drive in, all my applications freeze and only fix themselves once I unplug the drive.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		So, after everything, this is it. 
		The Sopranos has won, and my drive is now dead. 
		What I find funny about this is that at any point, even after having confirmed for a third time that The Sopranos was the reason, I could have just streamed it. 
		But I didn't. 
		And not because I wanted to have a copy of The Sopranos, but purely because I wanted to win. 
		This issue is so bizarre, I couldn't not attempt to investigate and fix it. 
		Anyway, the drive is dead now. 
		Whether I fix the drive or stream The Sopranos like I should have done in the beginning is a story for another potential faulty HDD adventures.
