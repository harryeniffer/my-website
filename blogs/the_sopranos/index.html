		Welcome back to part two of the faulty external HDD adventures.
		I am confused. 
		The Sopranos is breaking my drive. 
		Last night, shortly after posting my last rant, the drive fixed itself randomly. 
		"Great," I thought to myself, "I can go back to hoarding Linux ISOs." 
		But no.

		Last night the drive became writable again. 
		I created an NTFS partition on it and began to torrent again. 
		I installed Jellyfin as I had somehow managed to convince myself that Plex was the issue. 
		I torrented a few Linux ISOs, and everything seemed fine. 
		I could view them on multiple devices, locally and remotely. 
		However, I got greedy. For context, the last time my drive decided to break itself, it was while I was torrenting The Sopranos (.iso). 
		Until today, I thought the two were unrelated. 
		That was until I tried again, and to my surprise, the drive completely seized up and is no longer writable. 
		This is no coincidence. 
		The Sopranos is breaking my drive.

	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		My plan now is to leave it plugged into my Raspberry Pi and hope it randomly remounts itself and fixes like it did last time. 
		And if this does happen, I will just have to watch The Sopranos elsewhere. 
		Of course, I could've done this anyway, but I am a bit of an idiot. 
		Anyway, I hope you enjoyed another epic update/rant, and I'll be sure to keep you updated when my drive eventually gains sentience and runs away.
