	<h2><a style="color: #fe8019;">My linux distro of choice</a></h2>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		I use Arch Linux (technically Artix).
		I initially installed it after seeing memes about so-called Linux elitists who believe they are superior to others because they use a "harder to install" Linux distribution. 
		In reality, the truly superior ones are those who don't have to spend half an hour installing their operating system. 
		Anyway, I still drive Arch Linux because I like the DIY approach. 
		It's also very lightweight, so it runs on practically anything.
