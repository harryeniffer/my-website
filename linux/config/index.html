	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		As for my configurations, I use picom and transparent terminals to fit in with the Unixporn community, custom color themes to fit in with the Unixporn community, useless gaps to fit in with the Unixporn community, and so on. 
		My config only aims to make the environment look nicer, and I have applied little to no extra functionality whatsoever. 
		I also use feh to randomize my wallpaper every few minutes. 
		I stole a big repository of nature wallpapers off GitHub, and that worked for me. Sadly, I have no idea where I got that repository from and have since lost it.
