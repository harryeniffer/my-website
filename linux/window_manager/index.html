	<h2><a style="color: #fe8019;">My window manager of choice</a></h2>
	<p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 24px;">
		To fit the #minimalist #butistillusediscord theme, I went with DWM as my window manager. 
		All jokes aside, I think using DWM is one of the best experiences I have had when it comes to desktop environments/window managers on Linux. 
		It's very lightweight yet extremely customizable, thanks to <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/">https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/</a>, where users can submit addons to provide further functionality to the software. 
		There are no config files, so you edit the source code directly. 
		Yet even I, a big idiot who wouldn't consider themselves a developer in a million years, still managed to pick it up and start customizing the environment within minutes.
